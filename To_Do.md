## To Do

### Nav on index.html
- Put sitename in a more logo-y thing? Don't make it look like a link

### Pattern Design
- Make color palette more pleasing (https://css-tricks.com/re-pleasing-color-palettes/) ??
- Enable black or white text based on brightness of color in palette at bottom
- Sometimes it fails and I don't know why!!!

### About Page
- Better color scheme, less boring
- Turn keyword definition into rollover OR click for anyone on desktop (keep click for mobile)

## Done
- Remove in-sketch nav and update to HTML overlay
- Create "about" page with my info, stitch examples
- Remove "screenshot" function
- Clean up code labels
- Make some colors repeat twice in a row to create bands of color, both vertically and horizontally
- Make nav background refer to one of the palette colors
- Footer with copyright etc
- Size pics better
- Link to raw code
- Fix refresh on Safari
- Unified font that isn't Helvetica
