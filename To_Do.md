## To Do

### Pattern Design
- Sometimes it fails and I don't know why!!!

## Done
- Remove in-sketch nav and update to HTML overlay
- Create "about" page with my info, stitch examples
- Remove "screenshot" function
- Clean up code labels
- Make some colors repeat twice in a row to create bands of color, both vertically and horizontally
- Make nav background refer to one of the palette colors
- Footer with copyright etc
- Size pics better
- Link to raw code
- Fix refresh on Safari
- Unified font that isn't Helvetica
- Added logo
