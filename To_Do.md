## To Do

### Nav and Site
- Make nav prettier? 

### Pattern Design
- Make color palette more pleasing (https://css-tricks.com/re-pleasing-color-palettes/)
- Enable black or white text based on brightness of color in palette at bottom   
- Sometimes it fails and I don't know why!!!

### About Page
- Design
- Footer with copyright etc
- Rollover keywords in headline for definitions via Javascript?
- Fix link to my website (again)
- Size pics better
- Link to raw code

### General
- Fix refresh on Safari (May be fixed by moving to HTML buttons)
- Try out slight noise and/or gradient to make it look "realer"
- Unified font that isn't Helvetica

## Done
- Remove in-sketch nav and update to HTML overlay
- Create "about" page with my info, stitch examples
- Remove "screenshot" function
- Clean up code labels
- Make some colors repeat twice in a row to create bands of color, both vertically and horizontally
- Make nav background refer to one of the palette colors
