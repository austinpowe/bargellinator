    	<h1>Bargellinator is a generative pattern designer.</h1>
      <h2>It randomly creates a never-before-seen Bargello tapestry each time you load the page.</h2>
        <p>Bargello is an embroidery technique that became popular in the mid-70s but fell into unpopularity in the succeeding decades. It uses brightly colored yarn on canvas or plastic mesh to create repeating patterns.</p>

        <p>Because of Bargello's waning popularity, there simply isn't as many patterns available to the modern stitcher as there are for other fiber arts, like knitting, cross-stitch, embroidery, or weaving.</p>
        <p>This site my personal attempt to decode what makes Bargello patterns so fun and unique, while hopefully providing inspiration to other stitchers.</p>
